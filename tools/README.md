# streamer-template tools

Here will be a collection of tools, a lot of these will be in the form of
Python scripts because it'll largely be throwaway code of the type used by
engineers or researchers to more easily interact with and test the system.

I'll be using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) refer to the uv repo to
figure out how to install it.
